<p>There are lots of guides and tutorials online about how to do downhill slides from professionals online, but this is a guide coming from a fellow beginner who recently just figured it out and can share what worked for them. To start with, these are the guides that I followed when I was learning:</p>

<h2>Beginning Sliding</h2>
<p>To start learning to slide you need:</p>
<ul>
 <li>slide gloves</li>
 <li>helmet</li>
 <li>slide wheels</li>
 <li>any longboard</li>
</ul>
<img src=./images/pushup-slide.gif style="height:400px;">
<p>The first slide I learned was the two hand down pushup slide. For anyone afraid of sliding, this is perfect because there is almost zero risk of falling. Go on a small hill (you don't need much speed) and as you carve to approach the slide, squat down, put your hands out, and push out your body into a pushup position. Don't worry about not getting it the first time because even if your wheels don't break into a slide you will just go in a straight line and since you are on small hill just wait till you slow down and get back up.</p>
<h2>Coleman</h2>
<img src=./images/coleman.gif style="height:400px;">
<p>The Coleman slide was named after its inventor, Cliff Coleman. The Coleman is also known as a Heelside slide because your heels are to the hill. I originally began practicing this slide by going as fast as possible and then trying to twist my board into a slide. This method resulted in either the board not breaking into a slide and I would simply turn very hard or the wheels would catch and throw me off the board. What I found to be the best method to practice was finding a medium hill and going slowly down it (faster than for the pushup slide though). In this I started by only trying to slide to a stop. I tried to focus on really leaning my weight back onto the hand behind me and off of my wheels and anticipating the board pushing back so that I wouldn't be thrown off the board.</p>
<p>Once I was able to slide to a stop, I went down a larger hill and worked on trying to hook my coleman back up to keep going down the hill without stopping. For this step it really helped me a lot to wear knee pads, because whenever I fell I would always go to the hands and knees position (sliding on knee pads and slide gloves). Another thing I found helpful when getting out of the slide was to leave my hand down for a second longer than seemed nessesary in order to use it for balance as I stood up.</p>
<h2>Toeside</h2>
<img src=./images/toeside.gif style="height:400px;">
<p>The Toeside slide is essentially the pushup slide but only putting one hand down. The way I learned to do it was to grab rail of my board infront of my front foot and really lean into my hand on the ground as I put it down. It feels a lot different to do than leaning back in the Coleman, because you lean into/over it and not back. <a href="https://youtu.be/hJajtKI6ED0">This video of Zak Maytum from Venom Bushings really helped me visualize the movement of how to kick out into the slide.</a></p>
<h2>Next Step</h2>
<p>Once you learn how to slide your longboard it is time to begin good practices to avoid flatspots. I got quite a few from the earlier steps and am still working on getting all them out now that I know how to slide. You get flatspots on your wheels from sliding your board perpendicular to the hill. You should keep your board at a slight angle to allow your wheels to spin while you slide resulting in an even wear pattern. The best way I found to do this was to pendulum slide. This method is done exactly how it sounds, you swing the board out past perpendicular and bring it back all in one motion without the board stopping in one place.</p>
